streamgetter

-- record 
store all segments to disk
- with/without media segments
- whole dvr or cutoff
- all or some tracks
- allow for several independent recordings

-- check
- verify the stream, optionally with segment timestamp and format
- no store
- logging and alarming
- parameters checked
-- manifest http errors
-- time to respond
-- parsability
-- live edge distance
-- jitter in live edge
-- dvr window length
-- number of live periods >1
-- period continuity
-- segment accessability 
-- segment timestamps matching

-- fetch
- Allow access by fixed date 
_ Get last manifest at this date, 404 before and after
- rewrite basURL/representations according to availability to make it valid

-- loop
Play a loop of the recording
- provide a fixed time offset (or open a session)
- start (simplification) with the manifest of that date, as in fetch
- assume for simplicity it in the recording range
- send this manifest with the presentationTimeOffset adjusted to move the live edge to the current time (best would be same live delay as recording)
- loop points are before and after the recording
- function to append shifted&cut periods
- cutting need not be implemented right now, pto shift will do
- function to extract first and last availabilty from manifest
